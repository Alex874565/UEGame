    title: Treaty of Nice
    countryName: Nice
    description: The Treaty of Nice was signed in 2001 and entered into force in
      2003 to reform EU institutions in preparation for the enlargement to include
      countries from Eastern Europe. It focused on institutional balance, voting
      systems, and the composition of the European Commission. However, many viewed
      it as a temporary solution, with larger reforms anticipated later.
    question: 
    EuChoice: Ratify and Proceed with Enlargement
    EuChoiceDescription: 'The EU chose to ratify the Treaty of Nice, accepting its
      compromises to accommodate new member states while delaying more comprehensive
      reforms.


      The EU paved the way for the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, but
      many saw it as a patchwork solution.


      Member states with smaller populations
      gained more voting power, while larger states felt underrepresented.


      Citizens
      were generally indifferent, though some criticized the lack of deeper institutional
      changes.'

    title: Madrid Train Bombings
    countryName: Madrid
    description: 'In Madrid, Spain, there was a high-casualty bombing of the commuter
      rail system made by Islamist extremists, three days before the elections, leading
      to public anger and suspicion. This lead to the Spanish troops withdrawing
      from Iraq after the election.

      The EU decided to take measures against
      terrorist acts, by improving its counterterrorism and intelligence services,
      surveilance, intelligence sharing, and border controls, all while strengthening
      anti-terror laws.'
    question: What response should the EU have to these terrorist acts?
    EuChoice: Unity and Action
    EuChoiceDescription: "Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the EU responded
      with strong solidarity and took decisive action to improve internal security.
      A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator was appointed, and intelligence-sharing between
      member states was strengthened. These moves boosted public trust in the EU\u2019s
      unity and ability to act in times of crisis. However, the expansion of surveillance
      and data-sharing also raised concerns about civil liberties, sparking debates
      about how to balance security with fundamental rights."

        Publicly question EU involvement in
        foreign conflicts to address root causes.


        Encourage Spain to delay

      consequences: 'Increased EU Security: Enhanced cooperation among member states
        in intelligence sharing and counterterrorism efforts resulted in more efficient
        response times to future threats


        Public Trust in the EU Grows:
        The strong response of the EU boosts its reputation as a united, proactive
        force against terrorism


        Civil Liberties Concerns: The push for
        more surveillance and intelligence-sharing lead to concerns about privacy
        and the erosion of civil liberties


        Internal EU Unity: The EU is
        seen as more united and coordinated, but the potential conflict between national
        sovereignty and EU centralization could create division in future decision-making'

    - title: Balance of Power and Privacy
      description: "Issue a neutral, factual public statement\n\nPromote regional
        cooperation between member states\n\nProvide optional frameworks for intelligence-sharing;
        no mandates\n\nOffer grants to national anti-radicalization programs\n\nSupport
        Spain\u2019s decision to hold timely elections as a sign of resilience"
      consequences: "Moderate Security Gains: The EU encourages cooperation without
        centralization. Some member states take proactive steps in improving counterterrorism
        measures and intelligence-sharing, but without a unified framework, some
        gaps remain in overall security effectiveness\n\nPreserved Civil Liberties:
        The EU prioritizes the protection of civil liberties, avoiding mass surveillance
        programs. This leads to higher public trust, particularly in countries with
        a strong tradition of individual freedoms, though some critics argue the
        EU isn\u2019t doing enough to secure its borders\n\nMixed Public Perception:
        The EU\u2019s balanced approach is seen as pragmatic by some, but ineffective
        by others. The lack of decisive action in addressing threats might leads
        to dissatisfaction in member states facing growing security risks. Citizens
        begin questioning whether the EU is strong enough to handle such crises\n\nInternal
        Division on Security: Member states retain significant autonomy, and some
        countries feel they are left to handle security on their own. This leads
        to varying levels of commitment to EU-wide counterterrorism efforts, and
        future cooperation may be less unified\n\nStay silent on Iraq to avoid dividing
        EU foreign policy\n\nModerate Influence on Global Stage: The EU avoids significant
        rifts with non-EU countries but also doesn\u2019t assert itself as a strong
        global player in counterterrorism, leaving a gap in its role as a major diplomatic
        force"

    - title: Cautious Sovereignism
      description: "Refrain from public comment until investigations are complete.\n\nLeave
        all counterterrorism efforts to national governments.\n\nAvoid any new surveillance
        or intelligence-sharing initiatives.\n\nFocus solely on policing and justice,
        not social programs.\n\nMake no comment on Spain\u2019s election timing to

      consequences: 'Parliament''s authority is challenged, leading to growing institutional
        tension.


        Public protests and media criticism increase, especially
        from human rights groups.


        Member states feel empowered, but critics
        accuse the EU of tolerating outdated values.


        Long-term democratic
        legitimacy of the Commission is questioned.'

      a major setback. Designed to streamline EU decision-making and symbolically
      unite member states under a single foundational treaty, the Constitution was
      rejected by public referendums in France and the Netherlands. \nThis unexpected
      outcome triggered a political crisis and forced the EU to reconsider its approach
      to integration and institutional reform."
    question: What response should the EU have to these terrorist acts?
    EuChoice: Reflect and Rework
    EuChoiceDescription: "The EU chose to pause the ratification process, enter a
      \"period of reflection,\" and eventually rework the Constitution into a more
      modest treaty \u2014 the Treaty of Lisbon, signed in 2007.\n"

      attack in the UK since the 1980s and occurred just one day after London won
      the bid to host the 2012 Olympics. \nThe attack shocked Europe and reignited
      urgent debates over security, integration, and EU-wide counterterrorism cooperation."
