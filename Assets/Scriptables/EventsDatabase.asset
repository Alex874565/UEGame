    title: Treaty of Nice
    countryName: Nice
    description: The Treaty of Nice was signed in 2001 and entered into force in
      2003 to reform EU institutions in preparation for the enlargement to include
      countries from Eastern Europe. It focused on institutional balance, voting
      systems, and the composition of the European Commission. However, many viewed
      it as a temporary solution, with larger reforms anticipated later.
    question: 
    EuChoice: Ratify and Proceed with Enlargement
    EuChoiceDescription: 'The EU chose to ratify the Treaty of Nice, accepting its
      compromises to accommodate new member states while delaying more comprehensive
      reforms.


      The EU paved the way for the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, but
      many saw it as a patchwork solution.


      Member states with smaller populations
      gained more voting power, while larger states felt underrepresented.


      Citizens
      were generally indifferent, though some criticized the lack of deeper institutional
      changes.'

    title: Madrid Train Bombings
    countryName: Madrid
    description: 'In Madrid, Spain, there was a high-casualty bombing of the commuter
      rail system made by Islamist extremists, three days before the elections, leading
      to public anger and suspicion. This lead to the Spanish troops withdrawing
      from Iraq after the election.

      The EU decided to take measures against
      terrorist acts, by improving its counterterrorism and intelligence services,
      surveilance, intelligence sharing, and border controls, all while strengthening
      anti-terror laws.'
    question: What response should the EU have to these terrorist acts?
    EuChoice: Unity and Action
    EuChoiceDescription: "Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the EU responded
      with strong solidarity and took decisive action to improve internal security.
      A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator was appointed, and intelligence-sharing between
      member states was strengthened. These moves boosted public trust in the EU\u2019s
      unity and ability to act in times of crisis. However, the expansion of surveillance
      and data-sharing also raised concerns about civil liberties, sparking debates
      about how to balance security with fundamental rights."

        or intelligence-sharing initiatives.\n\nFocus solely on policing and justice,
        not social programs.\n\nMake no comment on Spain\u2019s election timing to
        respect sovereignty."
      consequences: 'Parliament''s authority is challenged, leading to growing institutional
        tension.


        Public protests and media criticism increase, especially
        from human rights groups.


        Member states feel empowered, but critics
        accuse the EU of tolerating outdated values.


        Long-term democratic
        legitimacy of the Commission is questioned.'

      description: "Issue a neutral, factual public statement\n\nPromote regional
        cooperation between member states\n\nProvide optional frameworks for intelligence-sharing;
        no mandates\n\nOffer grants to national anti-radicalization programs\n\nSupport
        Spain\u2019s decision to hold timely elections as a sign of resilience"
      consequences: "Moderate Security Gains: The EU encourages cooperation without
        centralization. Some member states take proactive steps in improving counterterrorism
        measures and intelligence-sharing, but without a unified framework, some
        gaps remain in overall security effectiveness\n\nPreserved Civil Liberties:
        The EU prioritizes the protection of civil liberties, avoiding mass surveillance
        programs. This leads to higher public trust, particularly in countries with
        a strong tradition of individual freedoms, though some critics argue the
        EU isn\u2019t doing enough to secure its borders\n\nMixed Public Perception:
        The EU\u2019s balanced approach is seen as pragmatic by some, but ineffective
        by others. The lack of decisive action in addressing threats might leads
        to dissatisfaction in member states facing growing security risks. Citizens
        begin questioning whether the EU is strong enough to handle such crises\n\nInternal
        Division on Security: Member states retain significant autonomy, and some
        countries feel they are left to handle security on their own. This leads
        to varying levels of commitment to EU-wide counterterrorism efforts, and
        future cooperation may be less unified\n\nStay silent on Iraq to avoid dividing
        EU foreign policy\n\nModerate Influence on Global Stage: The EU avoids significant
        rifts with non-EU countries but also doesn\u2019t assert itself as a strong
        global player in counterterrorism, leaving a gap in its role as a major diplomatic
        force"

      unite member states under a single foundational treaty, the Constitution was
      rejected by public referendums in France and the Netherlands. \nThis unexpected

      attack in the UK since the 1980s and occurred just one day after London won

    countryName: Brussels
    description: "The EU Services Directive aimed to boost economic growth by allowing
      service providers to operate more freely across member states, breaking down
      national barriers in the internal market. While it promised greater efficiency
      and competition, it also triggered fears of social dumping, loss of worker
      protections, and a \"race to the bottom\" in wages and standards\u2014especially
      due to the controversial \"country of origin\" principle."
    question: How should we address the directive?
    EuChoice: Compromise Directive - Growth with Guardrails
    EuChoiceDescription: 'The final Services Directive passed in 2006 with major
      amendments. The controversial "country of origin" principle was removed, and
      worker protections were safeguarded after large-scale protests in countries
      like France and Belgium.


      The directive opened up many service sectors,
      particularly for small and medium businesses.


      It avoided major political
      fallout, though dissatisfaction remained on both extremes.


      It became
      a model of cautious integration: economic progress tempered by social concern.'

    description: "The EU negotiated an Association Agreement with Ukraine to deepen
      political and economic ties. It includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade
      Area (DCFTA), closer alignment with EU laws, and stronger democratic standards.
      However, when Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended
      the signing under pressure from Moscow in late 2013, mass protests erupted
      (Euromaidan), leading to his ousting.\n\nThe EU has to decide how boldly to
      support Ukraine amid internal turmoil and rising Russian aggression."
    question: How boldly should the EU support Ukraine?

    EuChoiceDescription: 'The EU signed the political parts of the Association Agreement
      with Ukraine in March 2014, shortly after Yanukovych fled and Crimea was annexed
      by Russia. The economic sections were signed in June. The EU also began a broad
      support program, including aid, advisory missions, and sanctions on Russia.


      The
      EU emerged as a key actor in Eastern Europe and a target of Russian geopolitical
      opposition.


      Ukraine deepened reforms, though at great internal and
      external cost.


      Member states were divided over the long-term commitment,
      but unity held.'
