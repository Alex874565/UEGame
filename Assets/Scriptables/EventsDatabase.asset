    title: Treaty of Nice
    countryName: Nice
    description: The Treaty of Nice was signed in 2001 and entered into force in
      2003 to reform EU institutions in preparation for the enlargement to include
      countries from Eastern Europe. It focused on institutional balance, voting
      systems, and the composition of the European Commission. However, many viewed
      it as a temporary solution, with larger reforms anticipated later.
    question: 
    EuChoice: Ratify and Proceed with Enlargement
    EuChoiceDescription: 'The EU chose to ratify the Treaty of Nice, accepting its
      compromises to accommodate new member states while delaying more comprehensive
      reforms.


      The EU paved the way for the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, but
      many saw it as a patchwork solution.


      Member states with smaller populations
      gained more voting power, while larger states felt underrepresented.


      Citizens
      were generally indifferent, though some criticized the lack of deeper institutional
      changes.'

    title: Madrid Train Bombings
    countryName: Madrid
    description: 'In Madrid, Spain, there was a high-casualty bombing of the commuter
      rail system made by Islamist extremists, three days before the elections, leading
      to public anger and suspicion. This lead to the Spanish troops withdrawing
      from Iraq after the election.

      The EU decided to take measures against
      terrorist acts, by improving its counterterrorism and intelligence services,
      surveilance, intelligence sharing, and border controls, all while strengthening
      anti-terror laws.'
    question: What response should the EU have to these terrorist acts?
    EuChoice: Unity and Action
    EuChoiceDescription: "Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the EU responded
      with strong solidarity and took decisive action to improve internal security.
      A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator was appointed, and intelligence-sharing between
      member states was strengthened. These moves boosted public trust in the EU\u2019s
      unity and ability to act in times of crisis. However, the expansion of surveillance
      and data-sharing also raised concerns about civil liberties, sparking debates
      about how to balance security with fundamental rights."

      description: "Issue a neutral, factual public statement\n\nPromote regional
        cooperation between member states\n\nProvide optional frameworks for intelligence-sharing;
        no mandates\n\nOffer grants to national anti-radicalization programs\n\nSupport
        Spain\u2019s decision to hold timely elections as a sign of resilience"
      consequences: "Moderate Security Gains: The EU encourages cooperation without
        centralization. Some member states take proactive steps in improving counterterrorism
        measures and intelligence-sharing, but without a unified framework, some
        gaps remain in overall security effectiveness\n\nPreserved Civil Liberties:
        The EU prioritizes the protection of civil liberties, avoiding mass surveillance
        programs. This leads to higher public trust, particularly in countries with
        a strong tradition of individual freedoms, though some critics argue the
        EU isn\u2019t doing enough to secure its borders\n\nMixed Public Perception:
        The EU\u2019s balanced approach is seen as pragmatic by some, but ineffective
        by others. The lack of decisive action in addressing threats might leads
        to dissatisfaction in member states facing growing security risks. Citizens
        begin questioning whether the EU is strong enough to handle such crises\n\nInternal
        Division on Security: Member states retain significant autonomy, and some
        countries feel they are left to handle security on their own. This leads
        to varying levels of commitment to EU-wide counterterrorism efforts, and
        future cooperation may be less unified\n\nStay silent on Iraq to avoid dividing
        EU foreign policy\n\nModerate Influence on Global Stage: The EU avoids significant
        rifts with non-EU countries but also doesn\u2019t assert itself as a strong
        global player in counterterrorism, leaving a gap in its role as a major diplomatic
        force"

      national barriers in the internal market. While it promised greater efficiency
      and competition, it also triggered fears of social dumping, loss of worker

      like France and Belgium.


      The directive opened up many service sectors,
      particularly for small and medium businesses.


      It avoided major political
      fallout, though dissatisfaction remained on both extremes.

      authoritarian regimes. Sparked by the self-immolation of a Tunisian street
      vendor, the Arab Spring rapidly spreads to Egypt, Libya, Syria, and beyond.
      Citizens demand democracy, dignity, and jobs\u2014but as some regimes fall,
      others respond with violent repression.\n\nThe EU watches closely as its southern
      neighbourhood destabilizes, raising urgent questions: Should the EU support
      uprisings, risking instability? How should it manage waves of migration, energy
      uncertainty, and new foreign policy risks?"

      the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) review, and increases funding for democratic

      faces major challenges in Libya and Syria.\n\nThe EU earns global praise for
      its support of democracy.\n\nThe fallout from failed revolutions leads to long-term
      instability and migration flows.\n\nThe crisis sparks internal EU debates about

    title: Greek Debt Crisis
    countryName: Athens
    description: "Pope Francis addressed the European Parliament in Strasbourg \u2014
      the first papal visit since Pope John Paul II in 1988. Speaking to MEPs, Francis
      delivered a powerful message: Europe must return to its roots in human dignity,
      solidarity, and responsibility, warning against turning into a \u201Cgrandmother
      Europe,\u201D aged and weary, more focused on bureaucracy than people.\n\nHis
      speech was widely interpreted as a moral wake-up call during a time of rising
      populism, economic disillusionment, and waning faith in European ideals. EU
      institutions have to decide how to respond to this high-profile appeal for
      a more values-driven Union."
    question: How should the EU deal with the Greek Debt Crisis?
    EuChoice: "Save the Euro \u2013 Offer a Third Bailout with Conditions"
    EuChoiceDescription: "Despite the Greek referendum rejecting austerity, the EU
      and Greece agreed in July 2015 to a third bailout worth \u20AC86 billion. It
      came with strict oversight, tax hikes, and pension reforms. Tsipras accepted
      the terms after internal and external pressure, avoiding Grexit but sparking
      political backlash.\n\nGreece remained in the eurozone, but public trust in
      both the EU and Tsipras eroded.\n\nThe crisis exposed deep divisions in EU
      economic governance and solidarity.\n\nThe EU retained its monetary integrity
      but at high social and political cost."

      in the EU, mostly through Greece and Italy. The images of overcrowded boats,

      the Union.\n\nThe EU faces immense pressure to act. But member states are deeply
      divided\u2014some calling for compassion and resettlement, others erecting
      fences and closing borders. The crisis tests the EU\u2019s commitment to human
      rights, free movement, and shared responsibility."
    question: How should the EU handle the migration crisis?
    EuChoice: Adopt a Quota-Based Relocation System
    EuChoiceDescription: The EU introduced a mandatory relocation scheme in 2015
      to distribute asylum seekers across member states. However, many countries
      refused to comply, and implementation was patchy. The EU also expanded Frontex,
      made agreements with Turkey to reduce flows, and struggled to balance values
      with political realities.
