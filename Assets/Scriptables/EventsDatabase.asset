    title: Treaty of Nice
    countryName: Nice
    description: The Treaty of Nice was signed in 2001 and entered into force in
      2003 to reform EU institutions in preparation for the enlargement to include
      countries from Eastern Europe. It focused on institutional balance, voting
      systems, and the composition of the European Commission. However, many viewed
      it as a temporary solution, with larger reforms anticipated later.
    question: 
    EuChoice: Ratify and Proceed with Enlargement
    EuChoiceDescription: 'The EU chose to ratify the Treaty of Nice, accepting its
      compromises to accommodate new member states while delaying more comprehensive
      reforms.


      The EU paved the way for the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, but
      many saw it as a patchwork solution.


      Member states with smaller populations
      gained more voting power, while larger states felt underrepresented.


      Citizens
      were generally indifferent, though some criticized the lack of deeper institutional
      changes.'

    title: Madrid Train Bombings
    countryName: Madrid
    description: 'In Madrid, Spain, there was a high-casualty bombing of the commuter
      rail system made by Islamist extremists, three days before the elections, leading
      to public anger and suspicion. This lead to the Spanish troops withdrawing
      from Iraq after the election.

      The EU decided to take measures against
      terrorist acts, by improving its counterterrorism and intelligence services,
      surveilance, intelligence sharing, and border controls, all while strengthening
      anti-terror laws.'
    question: What response should the EU have to these terrorist acts?
    EuChoice: Unity and Action
    EuChoiceDescription: "Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the EU responded
      with strong solidarity and took decisive action to improve internal security.
      A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator was appointed, and intelligence-sharing between
      member states was strengthened. These moves boosted public trust in the EU\u2019s
      unity and ability to act in times of crisis. However, the expansion of surveillance
      and data-sharing also raised concerns about civil liberties, sparking debates
      about how to balance security with fundamental rights."

      description: "Issue a neutral, factual public statement\n\nPromote regional
        cooperation between member states\n\nProvide optional frameworks for intelligence-sharing;
        no mandates\n\nOffer grants to national anti-radicalization programs\n\nSupport
        Spain\u2019s decision to hold timely elections as a sign of resilience"
      consequences: "Moderate Security Gains: The EU encourages cooperation without
        centralization. Some member states take proactive steps in improving counterterrorism
        measures and intelligence-sharing, but without a unified framework, some
        gaps remain in overall security effectiveness\n\nPreserved Civil Liberties:
        The EU prioritizes the protection of civil liberties, avoiding mass surveillance
        programs. This leads to higher public trust, particularly in countries with
        a strong tradition of individual freedoms, though some critics argue the
        EU isn\u2019t doing enough to secure its borders\n\nMixed Public Perception:
        The EU\u2019s balanced approach is seen as pragmatic by some, but ineffective
        by others. The lack of decisive action in addressing threats might leads
        to dissatisfaction in member states facing growing security risks. Citizens
        begin questioning whether the EU is strong enough to handle such crises\n\nInternal
        Division on Security: Member states retain significant autonomy, and some
        countries feel they are left to handle security on their own. This leads
        to varying levels of commitment to EU-wide counterterrorism efforts, and
        future cooperation may be less unified\n\nStay silent on Iraq to avoid dividing
        EU foreign policy\n\nModerate Influence on Global Stage: The EU avoids significant
        rifts with non-EU countries but also doesn\u2019t assert itself as a strong
        global player in counterterrorism, leaving a gap in its role as a major diplomatic
        force"

      national barriers in the internal market. While it promised greater efficiency
      and competition, it also triggered fears of social dumping, loss of worker

      like France and Belgium.


      The directive opened up many service sectors,
      particularly for small and medium businesses.


      It avoided major political
      fallout, though dissatisfaction remained on both extremes.

    title: Arab Spring
    countryName: Sidi Bouzid
    description: "Across North Africa and the Middle East, protests erupt against
      authoritarian regimes. Sparked by the self-immolation of a Tunisian street
      vendor, the Arab Spring rapidly spreads to Egypt, Libya, Syria, and beyond.
      Citizens demand democracy, dignity, and jobs\u2014but as some regimes fall,
      others respond with violent repression.\n\nThe EU watches closely as its southern
      neighbourhood destabilizes, raising urgent questions: Should the EU support
      uprisings, risking instability? How should it manage waves of migration, energy
      uncertainty, and new foreign policy risks?"
    question: What should we do about the Arab Spring?
    EuChoice: "Support Democratic Movements \u2013 Take a Principled Stand"
    EuChoiceDescription: "The EU suspends cooperation with violent regimes, launches
      the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) review, and increases funding for democratic
      transitions. It plays a key role in supporting Tunisia\u2019s transition, but
      faces major challenges in Libya and Syria.\n\nThe EU earns global praise for
      its support of democracy.\n\nThe fallout from failed revolutions leads to long-term
      instability and migration flows.\n\nThe crisis sparks internal EU debates about
      foreign policy coherence and migration burden-sharing."

    - title: "Support Democratic Movements \u2013 Take a Principled Stand"
      description: Provide political and financial support to pro-democracy actors,
        suspend ties with authoritarian regimes, and prepare for post-revolution
        aid.
      consequences: 'The EU is seen as upholding its values of democracy and human
        rights.


        Some transitions succeed (e.g. Tunisia), but others descend
        into chaos (e.g. Libya, Syria).


        Instability triggers increased
        migration and regional conflict spillovers.'

        Protesters and civil society accuse Brussels of hypocrisy
        and moral cowardice.

    title: Syria Civil War
    countryName: Daraa
    description: "Civil unrest in Syria has escalated into a full-blown multi-sided
      war. President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s crackdown on protesters sparks rebellion,
      but regional and global powers quickly enter the fray. Russia, Iran, the U.S.,
      Turkey, and extremist groups like ISIS turn Syria into a geopolitical battlefield. 
      The humanitarian toll is staggering: hundreds of thousands dead, millions displaced,
      and a massive refugee wave moving toward Europe. The EU faces mounting pressure
      to act, but divisions over intervention, asylum, and diplomacy are sharp. Should
      it take a lead in peace efforts, focus on humanitarian support, or insulate
      itself?"
    question: How should the EU navigate the Syrian Civil War?
    EuChoice: "Push for Ratification \u2013 Modernize the EU"
    EuChoiceDescription: "The EU boosts funding to Frontex, signs the EU-Turkey migration
      deal, and increases support to Jordan and Lebanon to shelter refugees near
      Syria. While criticized by rights groups, the approach stabilizes the bloc\u2019s
      internal politics.  Asylum applications in Europe decrease sharply.  Tensions
      rise with Turkey over human rights and political conditions.  The EU remains
      a secondary player in ending the war but contains direct fallout."

        funding, and secure external borders to contain refugee inflow.
      consequences: "Refugee arrivals drop, reducing short-term political pressure.\n\nHuman
        rights groups criticize the EU for failing to address root causes.\n\nCooperation
        with Turkey becomes key\u2014and controversial."

      description: Accept the 2005 constitutional failure and keep operating under
        the Nice Treaty rules.
      consequences: "The treaty avoids political battles, but leaves institutions
        strained under enlargement.\n\nIt hampers EU\u2019s ability to act efficiently,
        especially with 27+ members.\n\nIt is widely seen as a retreat from ambition."
