    title: Treaty of Nice
    description: "The EU adopted the Treaty of Nice! \nIt presumes: \n1. Assigning
      a weighted number of votes for each country based on its population; \n2. Limiting
      the number of comission members to 1 per state; \n3. Improved the functioning
      of the European Court of Justice;  \n4. Allowed groups of minimum 9 countries
      to collaborate in specific areas, even if not all countries are ready or want
      to join. \nIt sets the grounds for a future enlargement."

    title: Madrid Train Bombings
    description: 'In Madrid, Spain, there was a high-casualty bombing of the commuter
      rail system made by Islamist extremists, three days before the elections, leading
      to public anger and suspicion. This lead to the Spanish troops withdrawing
      from Iraq after the election.

      The EU decided to take measures against
      terrorist acts, by improving its counterterrorism and intelligence services,
      surveilance, intelligence sharing, and border controls, all while strengthening
      anti-terror laws.'

    question: What response should the EU have to these terrorist acts?

    EuChoice: Unity and Action
    EuChoiceDescription: "Following the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the EU responded
      with strong solidarity and took decisive action to improve internal security.
      A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator was appointed, and intelligence-sharing between
      member states was strengthened. These moves boosted public trust in the EU\u2019s
      unity and ability to act in times of crisis. However, the expansion of surveillance
      and data-sharing also raised concerns about civil liberties, sparking debates
      about how to balance security with fundamental rights."
    choices:
    - title: Unity and Action
      description: 'Issue a strong solidarity statemenet with Spain


        Issue
        a centralized terrorism task force under Europol


        Fund community-based
        anti-radicalization systems


        Publicly question EU involvement in
        foreign conflicts to address root causes.


        Encourage Spain to delay
        elections for stability'
      consequences: 'Increased EU Security: Enhanced cooperation among member states
        in intelligence sharing and counterterrorism efforts resulted in more efficient
        response times to future threats


        Public Trust in the EU Grows:
        The strong response of the EU boosts its reputation as a united, proactive
        force against terrorism


        Civil Liberties Concerns: The push for
        more surveillance and intelligence-sharing lead to concerns about privacy
        and the erosion of civil liberties


        Internal EU Unity: The EU is
        seen as more united and coordinated, but the potential conflict between national
        sovereignty and EU centralization could create division in future decision-making'

    - title: Balance of Power and Privacy
      description: "Issue a neutral, factual public statement\n\nPromote regional
        cooperation between member states\n\nProvide optional frameworks for intelligence-sharing;
        no mandates\n\nOffer grants to national anti-radicalization programs\n\nSupport
        Spain\u2019s decision to hold timely elections as a sign of resilience"
      consequences: "Moderate Security Gains: The EU encourages cooperation without
        centralization. Some member states take proactive steps in improving counterterrorism
        measures and intelligence-sharing, but without a unified framework, some
        gaps remain in overall security effectiveness\n\nPreserved Civil Liberties:
        The EU prioritizes the protection of civil liberties, avoiding mass surveillance
        programs. This leads to higher public trust, particularly in countries with
        a strong tradition of individual freedoms, though some critics argue the
        EU isn\u2019t doing enough to secure its borders\n\nMixed Public Perception:
        The EU\u2019s balanced approach is seen as pragmatic by some, but ineffective
        by others. The lack of decisive action in addressing threats might leads
        to dissatisfaction in member states facing growing security risks. Citizens
        begin questioning whether the EU is strong enough to handle such crises\n\nInternal
        Division on Security: Member states retain significant autonomy, and some
        countries feel they are left to handle security on their own. This leads
        to varying levels of commitment to EU-wide counterterrorism efforts, and
        future cooperation may be less unified\n\nStay silent on Iraq to avoid dividing
        EU foreign policy\n\nModerate Influence on Global Stage: The EU avoids significant
        rifts with non-EU countries but also doesn\u2019t assert itself as a strong
        global player in counterterrorism, leaving a gap in its role as a major diplomatic
        force"

    - title: Cautious Sovereignism
      description: "Refrain from public comment until investigations are complete.\n\nLeave
        all counterterrorism efforts to national governments.\n\nAvoid any new surveillance
        or intelligence-sharing initiatives.\n\nFocus solely on policing and justice,
        not social programs.\n\nMake no comment on Spain\u2019s election timing to
        respect sovereignty."
      consequences: 'Parliament''s authority is challenged, leading to growing institutional
        tension.


        Public protests and media criticism increase, especially
        from human rights groups.


        Member states feel empowered, but critics
        accuse the EU of tolerating outdated values.


        Long-term democratic
        legitimacy of the Commission is questioned.'
